Hello! I'm an enthusiastic and aspiring web developer, currently immersing myself in the world of coding and web technologies. My journey into web development began with a fascination for how websites are built and how they function. Iâ€™m dedicated to learning and developing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web technologies to create engaging and user-friendly websites.

While I'm just starting out, I am passionate about coding and eager to learn more. I believe in continuous learning and am always looking for new challenges to improve my skills. I am particularly interested in front-end development and enjoy bringing creative designs to life through code.

I am committed to developing a strong foundation in web development and look forward to growing my expertise in this field.

Skills:  REACT / JS / HTML / CSS

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning mongodb, node js.
